I created descriptive analyses on some neighborhood-level socioeconomic status factors for GA counties from 2010 to 2019. The source data are publicly available from the US Census Bureau's five-year American Community Survey (ACS).

## Download the US Census Bureau data
I downloaded ACS data by an R package named _tidycensus_. Three factors at county level were included: percent of population in poverty, percent of households with annual income less than $35,000, and percent of households without vehicles. 
```{r,load-online-data,echo = FALSE,message=FALSE}
census_api_key("9664bc70fc2e3c3b84e6cff9cb6f37f13691738d",install = T,overwrite = T) #apply my API key

poverty_domain_list <- c("B17001_001","B17001_002","B19001_001","B19001_002","B19001_003","B19001_004","B19001_005","B19001_006","B19001_007","B08141_001","B08141_002")
year <- c(2010:2019)
poverty_domain <- matrix(nrow = 0,ncol = 14,dimnames = list(NULL,c("GEOID","NAME",poverty_domain_list,"year")))
for(i in 1:length(year)){
  temp <- get_acs(geography = "county",
                  variables = poverty_domain_list,
                  year = year[i],
                  survey = "acs5",
                  state = 13,
                  output = "wide")
  temp$year <- year[i]
  poverty_domain <- rbind(poverty_domain,temp)
  rm(temp)
}
poverty_domain <- poverty_domain[,-grep('\\M$',colnames(poverty_domain))]
poverty_domain$in_poverty <- poverty_domain$B17001_002E/poverty_domain$B17001_001E * 100
poverty_domain$income_less_35000 <- apply(poverty_domain[,c("B19001_002E","B19001_003E","B19001_004E","B19001_005E","B19001_006E","B19001_007E")],1,sum)/poverty_domain$B19001_001E * 100
poverty_domain$no_car <- poverty_domain$B08141_002E/poverty_domain$B08141_001E * 100
poverty_domain <- poverty_domain[,c("GEOID","NAME","year","in_poverty","income_less_35000","no_car")]
```
```{r,get-a-look-at-data-in-dataframe,echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(poverty_domain[1:5,],col.names = c("GEOID","County name","Year","Pop. in poverty (%)","Household income less than 35000 (%)","No cars (%)"),
             "html")
```
## Descriptive analysis
I calculated the median of each factor for the `r dim(poverty_domain)[1]` counties in GA. In general, the percent of populations in poverty according to the federal standard has fluctuated around 22% in the past decade. The percent of households with the annual income less than $35,000 decreased about 7% FROM 2010. The percent of households that did not own a vehicle remained stable at around 2.5%.
```{r,table,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
poverty_domain$in_poverty <- sapply(poverty_domain$in_poverty,good_round)
poverty_domain$income_less_35000 <- sapply(poverty_domain$income_less_35000,good_round)
poverty_domain$no_car <- sapply(poverty_domain$no_car,good_round)
tmp <- knitr::kable(poverty_domain %>%
               dplyr::group_by(year) %>%
               dplyr::summarise(in_poverty_median = median(in_poverty,na.rm = T),income_less_35000_median = median(income_less_35000,na.rm = T),no_car_median = median(no_car,na.rm = T)),
             col.names = c("Year","Pop. in poverty (%)","Household income less than 35000 (%)","No cars (%)"))
add_header_above(tmp,c(" ","County median" = 3)) %>%
  kable_styling()
```
## Figure
The changes of the three factors over time from 2010 to 2019 in DeKalb County, GA were visualized as a time-series figure. 
```{r figs, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "\\label{fig:fits}Time series from 2010 to 2019 for DeKalb County, GA"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figs","time_series_plot_DeKalb.png"))
